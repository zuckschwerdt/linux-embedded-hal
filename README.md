# `linux-embedded-hal`

> Implementation of the [`embedded-hal`] traits for Linux devices

This project is developed and maintained by the [Embedded Linux team][team].

[`embedded-hal`]: https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal

## [Documentation](https://docs.rs/linux-embedded-hal)

## GPIO character device

Since Linux kernel v4.4 the use of sysfs GPIO was deprecated and replaced by the character device GPIO.
See [gpio-cdev documentation](https://github.com/rust-embedded/gpio-cdev#sysfs-gpio-vs-gpio-character-device) for details.

This crate includes feature flag `gpio_cdev` that exposes `CdevPin` as wrapper around `LineHandle` from [gpio-cdev](https://crates.io/crates/gpio-cdev).
To enable it update your Cargo.toml. Please note that in order to prevent `LineHandle` fd from closing you should
assign to a variable, see [cdev issue](https://github.com/rust-embedded/gpio-cdev/issues/29) for more details.
```
linux-embedded-hal = { version = "0.3", features = ["gpio_cdev"] }
```

`SysfsPin` can be still used with feature flag `gpio_sysfs`.

With `default-features = false` you can enable the features `gpio_cdev`, `gpio_sysfs`, `i2c`, and `spi` as needed.
